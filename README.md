In this project I have build a simplified, one-player version of the classic board game Battleship! 

In this version of the game, there is a single ship hidden in a random location on a 5x5 grid. The player will have 4 guesses to try to sink the ship.

Read through the comments in battleship.ipynb to understand how the game is built
